## Introduction

Finite automata, also known as finite state machines, are fundamental models in computer science and are used to describe the behavior of systems with a finite number of states. They have been extensively studied and are widely used in various areas of computer science, including language theory, compiler design, hardware design, and artificial intelligence. There are two types of finite automata: deterministic finite automata (DFA) and non-deterministic finite automata (NFA).
A DFA is a finite automaton that recognizes a regular language, where the transitions between states are determined by a fixed set of rules. On the other hand, an NFA is a finite automaton that allows for more than one transition for a given input symbol, which means that it can recognize a broader class of languages. While NFAs are more expressive than DFAs, they are also more complex to design and implement.

## Objectives

- Understand what an automaton is and what it can be used for.
- Provide a function in your grammar type/class that could classify the grammar based on Chomsky hierarchy.
- Implement conversion of a finite automaton to a regular grammar.
- Determine whether your FA is deterministic or non-deterministic.
- Implement some functionality that would convert an NFA to a DFA.
- Represent the finite automaton graphically (optional):
  - You can use external libraries, tools or APIs to generate the figures/diagrams.
  - Your program needs to gather and send the data about the automaton and the lib/tool/API return the visual representation.

## Implementation Description

#### `GetChomskyType` method

First of all, in the class `Grammar` I have implemented the method `GetChomskyType` that classifies the grammar based on the Chomsky Hierarchy. The program checks if there is a single symbol on the left side of the production and if this symbol is non-terminal. If the conditions are met for every production, then the conditional statement:

```
foreach (Production production in Rules)
    {
        if (production.LeftSide.Length > 1 || !(NonTerminalSymbols.Contains(production.LeftSide[0])))
        {
            hasUnitLeftSide = false;
        }
    }
```

is not executed and `hasUnitLeftSide` is `true`, which means that the grammar is of type 3 or of type 2. Next, there is checked one more time each production in the rules, and there is counted how many non-terminal symbols are on the right side of the production, and if there is only one symbol and also, if the symbol is the first or the last in the symbols list, this means that the grammar is the type 3:

```
// type 3 only if there is one non terminal symbol in the right side
    if (i == 1)
    {
        // type 3 only if the non terminal symbol is the first or the last symbol in the right side
        if (!(NonTerminalSymbols.Contains(production.RightSide[0])) && !(NonTerminalSymbols.Contains(production.RightSide[production.RightSide.Length - 1])))
        {
            type3 = false;
        }
    }
```

If the `type3` variable `false`, then the `type2` variable becomes `true`.
If there are more than one symbol on the left side of the production and all of this symbols are non-terminal, then the grammar is of type 1, else, it is of type 0:

```
foreach (Production production in Rules)
    {
        // type 1 only if the right side has only terminal symbols
        foreach (string symbol in production.LeftSide)
        {
            if (!(NonTerminalSymbols.Contains(symbol)))
            {
                type1 = false;
            }
        }
    }
```

#### `ToGrammar` method

To convert a finite automaton into a grammar, I assigned the states of the FA to the variable `nonTerminalSymbols`, the alphabet of FA to `nonTerminalSymbols`, starting state to the `startingSymbol` and I used the method `TransitionToProduction` to add productions into a list

## Results

Given my variant, 23:

VN={S, B, C},

VT={a, b, c},

P={

S → aB

B → aC

C → bB

C → c

C → aS

B → bB

}

These are the results for three compilations:

- `aac` <br>
  `abbbbbbbac`<br>
  `abac`<br>
  `aac`<br>
  `aac`<br>

- `aabbaaabaaaac` <br>
  `abbbabaaaaaabac`<br>
  `aaaabac`<br>
  `abbbac`<br>
  `abac`<br>

- `ababac` <br>
  `aabac`<br>
  `abbbbbbac`<br>
  `abbbaaaac`<br>
  `abbabaaaaaabbbaaaaaabbbbaaaaaabbaaabbac`<br>

Next, there is the output for testing the `CanGenerateString` method of the `FiniteAutomaton` class. The first three strings are also presented in the first three screenshots, and that's why we know that they can be generated by the rules of the grammar and the method also returns `true`. The next inputs contain symbols that are not in the alphabet, empty string, and a string that cannot be generated by the rules, and that's why the method returns `false`.

`Input 'abbabaaaaaabbbaaaaaabbbbaaaaaabbaaabbac': True` <br>
`Input 'aac': True` <br>
`Input 'abac': True` <br>
`Input 'asdss': False` <br>
`Input '': False` <br>
`Input 'abb': False` <br>
<br>

## Conclusion

Overall, this laboratory work has provided a good understanding of formal languages, grammar, and finite automata, as well as how to implement and manipulate them using code. The code examples and explanations provided in this report can be useful for anyone who wants to implement or learn more about these topics.

## Introduction

Context-free grammars (CFG) are widely used in computer science to describe the syntax of programming languages, natural languages, and other formal languages. However, CFGs can sometimes become complex and difficult to manipulate, hindering their practical applications. Therefore, simplification and normalization techniques are often applied to CFGs to improve their efficiency and ease of use.

Simplification of CFGs involves transforming them into simpler and more manageable forms without changing the language they generate. The simplification process can involve removing useless or unreachable symbols, merging equivalent or similar rules, eliminating recursion or left recursion, and converting a grammar into Chomsky normal form or Greibach normal form. By simplifying CFGs, we can reduce the complexity of parsers and improve the performance of algorithms that operate on these grammars.

Grammar normalization is another technique used to simplify CFGs. The goal of normalization is to transform a CFG into a standard form that allows for easier analysis and manipulation. Chomsky normal form requires that all production rules be either of the form A → BC or A → a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol.

## Objectives

- Learn about Chomsky Normal Form (CNF).
- Get familiar with the approaches of normalizing a grammar.
- Implement a method for normalizing an input grammar by the rules of CNF (bonus points for implementing methods for general-case grammars and for having unit test)
